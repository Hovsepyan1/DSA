## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer

### Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Hovsepyan1/DSA.git
cd DSA
No additional dependencies are required—pure standard library implementations.

Usage
Run any module directly. For example:

python Data_Structures/linked_list.py
python Sorting_Algorithms/quick_sort.py
Many modules include tests or demonstration code in a block like:


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage or testing
